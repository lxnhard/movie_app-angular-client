# MovieAppAngularClient

This repository contains the client side for my web application Watch-Til-Death, built with Angular and Angular Material. The web application provides users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies. The app implements JWT token-based user authentication.
